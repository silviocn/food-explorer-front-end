# ✅ FOOD EXPLORER ✅
## food explorer app: front-end (to access back end, please go to: https://github.com/silviocn/food-explorer-back-end)
## Here you can find the front-end deployed: https://food-explorer-by-silviocn.netlify.app/
## Status: Completed

## Project done as part of final evaluation of Explorer course, from Rocketseat School.
## This project is a prototype of a restaurant App, for making orders. It's possible to create an account to use the app as final user. It's also possible to create and administrator account.

## This app was built with JavaScript, using mainly NodeJs and ReactJs, basically with the following structure: components, migrations, states, hooks, icons, styled components. For the development of the app beekeeper was used as database and insomnia was used to test routes.

## To use this project, please don't forget to take a look at the document package.json, env.example and api.js in services folder (front-end). Also, build your own app using insomnia to create administrator user account or upload other images.
## To run the project locally as developer you need to activate server in both back end and front end projects, using "npm run dev". There is already a database document, but if you want a new one, you can delete it and type command "npm run migrate" to create migrations again.

## When creating the insomnia document, use the link below to "POST" (Create) a new administrator user directly, as the back end is already running online. You should write the data like this example on JSON format to make it work.

## Example of data: {
##	"name": "Administrator",
## 	"email": "administrator@email.com",
##	"password": "654321"
## }
## Back-end URL for new adm user: https://food-explorer-back-end-by-silviocn.onrender.com/adm or 'localhost:3333/adm' if locally.

## Or just use 'administrador@email.com' and password '123456' to log in as administrator
